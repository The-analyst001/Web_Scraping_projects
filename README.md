# Web_Scraping_projects
I had the opportunity to learn webscraping from the renowned data analyst @Alextheanalyst through one of his YouTube videos. With his guidance, I embarked on my first webscraping mini-project, which involved extracting a table representing the list of largest companies in the United States by revenue from the Wikipedia website. It was an incredibly enjoyable experience as I delved into the world of webscraping. In this project, I extensively used modules such as Pandas, BeautifulSoup, and requests, specifically leveraging the find_all() method. Extracting the desired table proved to be a particular challenge due to the presence of multiple tables on the webpage. However, with determination and perseverance, I successfully accomplished the task. The outcome was rewarding, and I found the entire experience both fruitful and enlightening.
